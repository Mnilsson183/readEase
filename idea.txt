Online Bookstore Management System

Description:
Create an online bookstore management system where users can browse books, add them to their cart, and place orders. This project involves implementing various data structures and algorithms for managing books, users, orders, and cart functionalities.

Features:

    User Authentication: Implement user authentication (sign up, login, logout).
    Book Management: Allow administrators to add, edit, and remove books from the system. Each book should have details like title, author, genre, price, etc.
    Search and Filter: Implement search and filter functionalities to help users find books based on title, author, genre, etc.
    Shopping Cart: Implement a shopping cart where users can add books while browsing and review the items before placing an order.
    Order Management: Allow users to place orders and view their order history. Administrators should be able to view all orders and mark them as shipped.
    Recommendation System: Implement a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their browsing and purchase history.
    Data Structures and Algorithms: Use data structures like arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and trees to efficiently manage books, users, orders, and cart functionalities. Implement algorithms for sorting, searching, and filtering books.

Technologies:

    Backend: Java with Spring Boot or Python with Django
    Frontend: React, Angular, or Vue.js
    Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing book, user, and order data
    Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization

Additional Challenges:

    Implement caching mechanisms to improve the performance of frequently accessed data.
    Use a queue data structure to manage order processing and shipping.
    Implement an algorithm for generating book recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
